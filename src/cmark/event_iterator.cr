module Cmark
  # An iterator that walks through a tree of nodes, starting from a root node, returning an `Event` with one node at a time,
  # together with information about whether the node is being entered or exited, and if it is modifiable.
  #
  # The iterator will first descend to a child node (returning an ENTER `Event`),
  # if there is one.
  # When there is no child, the iterator will go to the next sibling.
  # When there is no next sibling, the iterator will return to the parent (but returning an EXIT `Event`).
  # The iterator will stop after it reaches the root node again on exit.
  #
  # One natural application is an HTML renderer, where an ENTER event outputs an open tag and an EXIT
  # event outputs a close tag.
  # An iterator might also be used to transform an AST in some systematic way, for example, turning all
  # level-3 headings into regular paragraphs.
  #
  # NOTE: Nodes can be modified only after an EXIT event or an ENTER event for leaf nodes. The convenience
  # method `Event#modifiable?` checks that these conditions are met.
